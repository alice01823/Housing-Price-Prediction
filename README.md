# Housing-Price-Prediction

### Project Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the prices of residential properties based on various features. This project is crucial for real estate stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and investors, to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in properties.

### Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict housing prices accurately. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, the model will analyze the relationship between various features and housing prices to make reliable predictions.
