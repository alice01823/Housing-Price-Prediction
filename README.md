# Housing-Price-Prediction

### Project Overview
The Housing Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the prices of residential properties based on various features. This project is crucial for real estate stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and investors, to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in properties.

### Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict housing prices accurately. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, the model will analyze the relationship between various features and housing prices to make reliable predictions.

Data sources
Sales data: The primary data used for this analysis is the "Housing_Dataset.csv" file, which contains detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
- Excel
- Jupyter notebook

### Key Steps:
- Data Collection: Obtain the housing dataset from a reliable source or repository.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Perform feature scaling and normalization to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the distribution of features, correlations, and patterns within the dataset. Visualize the data to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and their impact on housing prices.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to extract meaningful information that enhances the predictive power of the model. Feature engineering may involve dimensionality reduction, interaction terms, or polynomial features.
- Model Selection and Training: Choose appropriate regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting. Train multiple models using the training dataset and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the selected models to improve their performance further. Techniques like grid search or random search can be employed for hyperparameter tuning.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using cross-validation techniques and validation datasets. Compare the models based on their predictive accuracy and generalization ability.
- Prediction and Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model to make real-time predictions on new data or integrate it into an application for practical use. Monitor the model's performance over time and update it as needed.
